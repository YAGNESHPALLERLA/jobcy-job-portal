# Railway Healthcheck Fix

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing during the "Network > Healthcheck" phase with "Healthcheck failure" error.

## Root Cause
Railway couldn't verify that the application was running properly because:
1. No health check endpoint was available
2. Server wasn't configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
3. Health check timeout was too short

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Health Check Endpoints
```javascript
// Root endpoint
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: "OK",
    message: "Job Portal API is running",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || "development"
  });
});

// Dedicated health check endpoint
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: "healthy",
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### 2. Updated Railway Configuration
- **Health Check Path**: Changed from `/` to `/health`
- **Timeout**: Increased from 100s to 300s
- **Server Binding**: Added `0.0.0.0` binding for Railway

### 3. Enhanced Server Configuration
```javascript
// Server now binds to all interfaces
server.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server running on port ${PORT}`);
  console.log(`📊 Health check available at: http://localhost:${PORT}/health`);
});

// Added error handling and graceful shutdown
server.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('❌ Server error:', error);
});

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('🛑 SIGTERM received, shutting down gracefully');
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('✅ Server closed');
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
```

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
- `jobcy-backend-main/app.js` - Added health check endpoints
- `jobcy-backend-main/server.js` - Enhanced server configuration
- `railway.json` - Updated health check configuration
- `jobcy-backend-main/railway.json` - Updated health check configuration

## Railway Service Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

### Health Check Configuration:
- **Path**: `/health`
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds
- **Expected Response**: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

## Testing Health Check

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Expected Responses:
```json
// GET /
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Job Portal API is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}

// GET /health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix Railway healthcheck configuration"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway**:
   - Railway will automatically detect the new configuration
   - The health check should now pass

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check Railway logs for successful startup
   - Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

## Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Still Fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   - Look for server startup messages
   - Check for any error messages

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required env vars are set
   - Check MongoDB connection string

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   cd jobcy-backend-main
   npm start
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

4. **Common Issues**:
   - **Database Connection**: Ensure MongoDB URI is correct
   - **Port Binding**: Server must bind to 0.0.0.0
   - **Environment Variables**: All required vars must be set

## Expected Result

After this fix, Railway should:
- ✅ Successfully build the application
- ✅ Deploy without errors
- ✅ Pass the health check
- ✅ Show "Deployment successful" status

The application will be accessible at your Railway URL with working health check endpoints.
