# Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing with "Error creating build plan with Railpack" because it couldn't determine the correct build configuration for a monorepo with both frontend and backend.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Root Configuration Files
- **`railway.json`** - Main Railway configuration pointing to backend
- **`package.json`** - Root package.json with proper scripts for Railway

### 2. Backend Configuration
- **`jobcy-backend-main/railway.json`** - Backend-specific Railway config
- **`jobcy-backend-main/.railwayignore`** - Excludes frontend files from backend deployment
- **Updated `jobcy-backend-main/package.json`** - Added proper scripts and engines

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Root `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cd jobcy-backend-main && npm start",
    "build": "cd jobcy-backend-main && npm install"
  }
}
```

#### Backend `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "echo 'No build step required for Node.js backend'",
    "postinstall": "echo 'Backend dependencies installed successfully'"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Railway Service Configuration

### For Backend Service:
1. **Root Directory**: `jobcy-backend-main`
2. **Build Command**: `npm install`
3. **Start Command**: `npm start`
4. **Node Version**: 18+

### Environment Variables Required:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Create Service**: Create a new service for the backend
3. **Set Root Directory**: Set to `jobcy-backend-main`
4. **Add Environment Variables**: Add all required env vars
5. **Deploy**: Railway will now build and deploy correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Check that the root directory is set to `jobcy-backend-main`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
4. Ensure Node.js version is 18+ in Railway settings

### Common Issues:
- **Railpack Error**: Usually means Railway can't determine build configuration
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check that all dependencies are in package.json
- **Port Issues**: Ensure the app listens on the PORT environment variable

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Railway
3. Check Railway logs for successful deployment
4. Test the API endpoints

## Files Created/Modified:
- `railway.json` (new)
- `package.json` (new)
- `jobcy-backend-main/railway.json` (new)
- `jobcy-backend-main/.railwayignore` (new)
- `jobcy-backend-main/package.json` (updated)
